"""
Run this example with:
    python -m github.twisted_main

This is an example of using Effect with Twisted.

It's important to note that none of the application code relies on Twisted --
this is the only file that has any dependencies on Twisted. There's also an
example of running the same application code in ``sync_main.py`` in the same
directory.

This code has these responsibilities:

- set up a dispatcher that knows how to find performers for all intents
  used in this application. The application uses ReadLine, HTTPRequest, and
  ParallelEffects.
- use :func:`effect.twisted.perform` to perform an effect, which returns a
  Deferred that we can return from our react function.
